## How to build?
Run the "rebuild.bat" file. You will need cmake for it to work.
This will create a "build" folder. The project sln file is inside.


## How to play?
Build and launch the game. A loading screen will appear for you to wait until everything is loaded. Once it is done, just press enter to start a game. You can pause via the escape key, and restart the game while paused by pressing "R". You can move left and right by pressing either the corresponding arrow keys or "Q" and "D".
